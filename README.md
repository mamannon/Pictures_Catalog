# Picture Catalog

Internet is nothing without pictures and movies. We have many excellent medias like YouTybe, Instagram, Picasa and so on, but I haven't found a portal, where you can upload pictures and select individually who can see them.

That was a good theme for a full stack course work! 

## Preface

Chosen technologies for this project are React and Javascript for front-end, ASP.NET and C# for back-end, SQL database written with Entity Framework Core and Cloudinary cloud service. The project is written by Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

A user needs to subscribe to the portal, and then he / she can upload pictures other subscribers to see, perhaps for all to see or only for those, who are allowed to see. Subscribers can apply a permit for each other to see a set of pictures they like to.
